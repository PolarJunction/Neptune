## Introduction
Neptune is a fishing mod for APICO. It provides a new and interactive way to progress through the game by fishing for interesting and exotic creatures.

## Getting started
To get started with Neptune, speak to Poseidon by the docks. He has a selection of fishing rods for purchase. Each rod is unique and has improved stats over the cheaper rods.
Catch fish by looking around for fishing spots - bubbling areas in the deep water, then casting your line into the fishing spot by clicking with a fishing rod equipped.

## Fish
There are a huge collection of fish and items that can be caught, increase your chances of catching more valuable fish by using a higher quality fishing rod.
Biomes are also important, some fish can only be caught in certain biomes.

## Rods
The higher quality rods have improved stats.
* Better chance to catch fish over junk items
* Fish will bite faster
* Longer time to respond to bites
* Fishing line length increases

## Bait
Some bait is occasionally available for purchase from the vendor on the docks, bait can be thrown in the water to attract fish.
The better quality the bait, the better the chances of attracting fish.

## Feedback & Bug Reporting
If you run into an issue, you can report it on the Neptune mod channel in the APICO Guilded server.
